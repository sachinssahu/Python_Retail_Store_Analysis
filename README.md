# Python_Retail_Store_Analysis
## Retail Store descriptive analysis along with basic KPIs, Churn Rate and BI.

I performed the Descriptive Analysis on the retail dataset consisting of transaction, customer and product datasheets.
I have implemented Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to analyse and plot the visualization for giving an output as a better understanding and reporting of day-to-day transactions of the store and to keep tabs on the performance of the store in various aspects to give business-oriented Insights.
